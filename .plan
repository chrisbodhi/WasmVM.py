THE GOAL HERE IS TO CREATE A SIMPLE WASM-LIKE MACHINE IN PYTHON
IN ORDER TO LEARN MORE COMPLETELY WHAT WASM DOES AND HOW.

- 🏃‍♂️ zomg, unit tests, please. push(6), push(-6), sub() --> 12
- 🏃‍♂️ create a visual representation of the entire machine that can be displayed in a web page
    - ✅ create an api for interacting with the machine
    - ✅ create a front-end with hardcoded buttons for interacting with the machine, and a display of the current state of the machine
    - Add an observer to the machine that sends updates to the front-end
    - For the observers and the web page -- can the observer be a websocket connections that sends updates?
- add in-vm memory of a specified capacity
    - ✅ start with creating a single page of memory, add support for adding up to n pages via stack instruction; check that max size is not exceeded
      - ✅ (memory (export "meme") 1 10) requests a block of memory that's 1 page long, with a maximum of 10 pages
      - how do we want the "export" keyword to work?
      - what about endianess? how do we want to handle it here?
- use the new in-vm memory for... come up with something. storing values at arbitrary locations via instruction?
- store local variables, eg (local $index i32)
    - find out if this is only in function scope
- read from host system memory
- write to host system memory
- add observers for in-vm memory
- `Le` instruction
- `Ge` instruction

- ✅ multiply instruction
- ✅ division instruction
- ✅ eq instruction
- ✅ eqz instruction
- ✅ `Lt` instruction
- ✅ `Gt` instruction
