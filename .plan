THE GOAL HERE IS TO CREATE A SIMPLE WASM-LIKE MACHINE IN PYTHON
IN ORDER TO LEARN MORE COMPLETELY WHAT WASM DOES AND HOW.

- add in-vm memory of a specified capacity
  - (memory (export "meme") 1 10) requests a block of memory that's 1 page long, with a maximum of 10 pages
  - âœ… start with creating a single page of memory, add support for adding up to n pages via stack instruction; check that max size is not exceeded
- use the new in-vm memory for... come up with something. storing values at arbitrary locations via instruction?
- what about endianess? how do we want to handle it here?
- store local variables, eg (local $index i32)
  - find out if this is only in function scope
- read from host system memory
- write to host system memory
- multiply instruction
- division instruction
